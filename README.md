## How we built this

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node
Express
Body Parser
MySQL
```

### Installing

gitignore is set up to ignore node modules ( so GiHub doesn't get crabby) thus, after cloning do the following:
-npm install 

if for some reason you get errors try installing dependencies individually
-npm install express
-npm install body parser
-npm install mysql

Need to look at the database?
To Get MySQL running:
on mac:
-go to terminal
mysql.server start
mysql -u root


## Deployment

when you are ready to deploy you may deploy to Heroku taking care to include the JAWSdb add-on
